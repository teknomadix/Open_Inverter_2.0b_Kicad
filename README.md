## This is a revision of [Johannes HÃ¼bner](https://johanneshuebner.com)'s OpenInverter 2.0 board.

---
The original board was designed in Eagle 6.0.  Since that is a bit antiquated now, and not open-source, it seemed important to have a more modern version of the hardware design files that are drawn up with an Open-source tool-set.
